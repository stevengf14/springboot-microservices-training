# springboot-microservices-training
This repository is based on a Course: Microservicios con Spring Boot y Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka -> https://www.udemy.com/course/microservicios-con-spring-boot-y-spring-cloud/

## About the course
Welcome to the Microservices course, you will learn line by line and from scratch how to build a microservices architecture with Spring Boot 2 and Spring Cloud, from the most basic concepts to a complete ecosystem of interconnected services through registration and dynamic scaling with Eureka (server of name), Spring Cloud Gateway (gateway) and Zuul, implementing load balancing with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer and Ribbon, fault tolerance with Resilience4J. Automate, scale, and deploy microservices in Docker containers to production.

You will also learn how to provide security in Zuul and protect our endpoints from the different microservices with Spring Cloud Security (OAuth2 and JWT). You will also learn to centralize all the configuration of the microservices using Spring Cloud Config Server and distributed traceability with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin.

We will also see how to secure Spring Cloud Gateway using the JJWT api to protect your endpoints from the different microservices.

During the course we will also work with various components of the Spring ecosystem such as IoC, Spring MVC, RestController, RESTful Web Services, HTTP client with RestTemplate and Feing, Spring Data JPA and Hibernate for persistence and CRUD (create, read, update and delete). , we will use MySQL 8 and PostgreSQL databases, among other topics.

In summary, you will learn to establish communication between microservices, enable load balancing, fault tolerance, scale up and down instances of microservices, oauth2 security, deployments in Docker containers and more.
